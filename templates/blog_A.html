            <h2>Python?</h2>
            <p>
              Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. 
              Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. 
              Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
              Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. 
              It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. 
              Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
              Python was created in the late 1980s, and first released in 1991, by Guido van Rossum as a successor to the ABC programming language. 
              Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced new features, such as list comprehensions, and a garbage collection system with reference counting, and was discontinued with version 2.7 in 2020.
              Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. 
              With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x and later are supported, with older versions still supporting e.g. Windows 7 (and old installers not restricted to 64-bit Windows).
              Python interpreters are supported for mainstream operating systems and available for a few more (and in the past supported many more). 
              A global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, a free and open-source reference implementation. 
              A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation, manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development.
              As of December 2020 Python ranked third in TIOBE’s index of most popular programming languages, behind C and Java.

            <h3>Flask</h3>
            <p>
              Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. 
              It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.
              It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. 
              However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. 
              Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.

            <h3>ABTest</h3>
            <p>
             A/B testing (also known as bucket testing or split-run testing) is a user experience research methodology. 
             A/B tests consist of a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B.
             It includes application of statistical hypothesis testing or "two-sample hypothesis testing" as used in the field of statistics. 
             A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable, 
             typically by testing a subject's response to variant A against variant B, and determining which of the two variants is more effective.
